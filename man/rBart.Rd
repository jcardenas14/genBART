rBart(design_info, gene_sets, design, contrast, block = NULL,
  correlation = NULL, gene.weights = NULL, var.prior = NULL,
  df.prior = NULL, nrot = 999)
}
\arguments{
\item{design_info}{design_info list generated from \code{desInfo}}

\item{gene_sets}{list of gene sets}

\item{design}{design matrix}

\item{contrast}{numeric matrix with rows corresponding to coefficients and
columns containing contrasts. May be a vector if there is only one
contrast.}

\item{block}{vector or factor specifying a blocking variable on the samples}

\item{correlation}{the inter-duplicate or inter-technical replicate
correlation}

\item{gene.weights}{numeric vector of directional (positive or negative)
probewise weights. Must have length equal to the number of rows in the
expression dataset.}

\item{var.prior}{prior value for residual variances. If not provided, this is
estimated from all the data using squeezeVar.}

\item{df.prior}{prior degrees of freedom for residual variances. If not
provided, this is estimated using squeezeVar.}

\item{nrot}{number of rotations used to compute the p-values.}

\description{
Run ROAST method and format results for BART
}
\details{
This function runs the ROAST gene set tests across all summary set
  statistics ("mean", "floormean", "mean50", and "msq") and returns formatted
  results for BART.
